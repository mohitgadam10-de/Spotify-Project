An analysis of cumulative popularity share and quarterly momentum shifts in music genres.
* 👑 **Market Share Leaders:** **Pop (31.60%)**, **Canadian Hip Hop (17.42%)**, and **Canadian R&B (17.06%)** combined command over **two-thirds** of total yearly engagement.
* 🍁 **Domestic Q4 Surge:** Market engagement consolidates heavily at year-end, with **Canadian Hip Hop** capturing a massive **16.52%** share of Q4 popularity.

### Dashboard 3️⃣: The Loudness Edge — Volume vs. Viral Potential
A technical look at how decibel levels influence track success and listener traction.
* 🔊 **The Loudness Advantage:** The data suggests a strong competitive advantage for louder tracks; tracks in the **"Extreme/Clipped"** category achieve the highest average popularity.
* 🏗️ **The Industry Standard:** **37.50% of tracks** reside in the "Industry Standard" loudness bin, yet these often underperform compared to their louder, more compressed counterparts.
* 📉 **The Ambient Gap:** Lower-volume tracks (**Silence/Ambient**) suffer from both low production volume and the lowest listener traction.
* 🧠 **Strategic Takeaway:** To maximize popularity potential, the data suggests production should lean toward the **"Loud/Compressed"** spectrum to match mainstream listener appeal.
